            <h2 id="about-me">ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I am a hardworking and passionate Computer Science student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fit.edu">Florida Tech</a> with Junior standing. I plan to specialize in Machine Learning and Neural Networks, and plan to use these tools to help those with disabilities or who have disadvantages when it comes to using technology.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am working as a Math Tutor with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spacecoastacademics.com/math-tutoring">Space Coast Academics</a>, where I help middle and high school students with improving their mathematics skills. I also conduct research at Florida Tech with Dr. White through his <a target="_blank" href="https://research.fit.edu/nets/">NEural TransmissionS(NETS)</a> Lab, where I use machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence in a research setting. Through this research I have done signal processing and presented at the 2024 MAA-FL Conference where I received the <em>Best Presentation Award for Undergraduate Students.</em></p>
            <p>In my free time I like to play chess and other video games, watch/play soccer, watch Formula 1, read, and code my personal website (not necessarily in that order, it depends on my mood).</p>

                        <figcaption>This was a project that was completed for an <em>Intro to Machine Learning</em> class. I used machine learning models to predict how much a player should be worth based on their playing statistics from a single season. I used 146 different statistics as inputs and the output was the valuation given by a specific website. I then completed an analysis "errors" that the model had since some of the valuations for players have intangible statistics that cannot be put into a numerical form.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>This project was completed for an <em>Intro to Software Engineering</em> class. Using an image recognition tool called Yolo and Google's Tesseract OCR for letter recognition I created an executable which could be used on a camera to scan license plates in Florida Tech parking lots. The purpose was to find cars parked in incorrect spots and make it easier for the security team to ticket illegally parked cars.</figcaption>

The construction was done through the <em>Vedo</em> Python library and the movement seen in the animation was done through forward kinematics algorithms.</figcaption>
